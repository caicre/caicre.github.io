**Research Interest**: Differential Privacy, Synthetic Data Generation, Private Data Analysis

I am Kuntai Cai, a PhD candidate at National University of Singapore (NUS), specializing in differential privacy and data synthesis under Prof. Xiaokui Xiao's mentorship. My academic journey began at Tsinghua University where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2019 before joining NUS.

In June 2021, I won [1st Place](https://drivendata.co/blog/differential-privacy-winners-sprint3/) in the NIST Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge, alongside my supervisor and collaborators. Our winning solution was a nuanced adaptation of our prior work, [PrivMRF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3476249.3476272). We have open-sourced [the code](https://github.com/caicre/PrivMRF) of PrivMRF, hoping it to become a basic building block in privacy protection. Subsequently, in August 2021, I was honored with the Research Achievement Award from the School of Computing, NUS. In SIGMOD2023, my collaborators and I published the first solution for synthesizing relational data with foreign keys under differential privacy.

I'm still committed to pushing the boundaries of differential privacy and data synthesis. The prospect of making further significant contributions to the safeguarding of privacy fills me with a profound sense of anticipation and enthusiasm.

**Research Interest**: Differential Privacy, Synthetic Data Generation, Private Data Analysis

I'm Kuntai Cai, a PhD student at National University of Singapore (NUS). I received my bachelor's degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University in 2019. Since then, I have been studying differential privacy and data synthesis under the guidance of Prof. Xiaokui Xiao at NUS.

In June 2021, in collaboration with my supervisor and partners, I won [1st Place](https://drivendata.co/blog/differential-privacy-winners-sprint3/) in the NIST Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge. The solution was a slightly modified version of our previous work, [PrivMRF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3476249.3476272). We have open-sourced [the code](https://github.com/caicre/PrivMRF) of PrivMRF, hoping it may serve as a basic building block for privacy protection. Later, in August 2021, I received the Research Achievement Award from the School of Computing, NUS.

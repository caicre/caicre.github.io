I am Kuntai Cai, a research scientist at TikTok Singapore, with a focus on privacy protection, databases, large language models, and graph neural networks. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, which I earned in 2019. My PhD focuses on differential privacy and data synthesis, conducted under the guidance of Professor Xiaokui Xiao at the National University of Singapore.

In June 2021, my supervisor, collaborators, and I won [1st Place](https://drivendata.co/blog/differential-privacy-winners-sprint3/) in the NIST Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge. Our winning solution was an innovative adaptation of our previous work, [PrivMRF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3476249.3476272), which we have open-sourced as a foundational tool for privacy protection. More recently, at SIGMOD 2023, my collaborators and I introduced **PrivLava**, the first solution for synthesizing relational data with foreign keys while ensuring differential privacy.

I am deeply committed to advancing research in privacy protection, large language models, and graph neural networks. My work seeks to bridge theoretical innovation with practical applications, driving progress in both academia and industry.
